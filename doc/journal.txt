setting up projecttemplate for RNA analysis. Did this same analysis previously, but want to organize and repeat.
put all the old stuff in a fold in this project called "oldAnalysis"
use small code pieces (in 'src') to process
1. munge and label columns and rows
2. set up gene translations , entrez-bsu-symbol. have functions for these
3. set up plotting functions for (small) gene lists
4. set up large gene list (e.g. regulon) analysis

-------

working on rna plotting/ to tables in
 'gene_expression_outputer.R' 
for plotting outside (excel for paper)
TODO: need to make entrez-to-bsu function next so that i can import the gene names from the entrez .csv file that i used for the protein analysis
then will output a data frame for mean and a separate one for sd.
can merge them outside maybe
